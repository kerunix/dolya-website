        Born from the reunion of Fabrice (drums) and Jaufré (bass), and the meeting with Florent (keyboard) and JB (guitar), the group Dolya has created a universe of its own: instrumental, resolutely prog, at the crossroads of synth-wave, ambient and industrial metal.

        The group’s 1st Ep, recorded at Studio Waïti in Toulouse by Yannick Tournier in June 2020, will give a first glimpse of the group’s universe. In spring 2021, Dolya plans to return to the studio for the recording of her first album.
